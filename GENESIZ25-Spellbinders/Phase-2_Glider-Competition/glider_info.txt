Model Glider Building Competition ✈️

“It is possible to fly without motors,
but not without knowledge and skill.”
– Wilbur Wright

In this phase, our team designed and built a motor-less model glider
using approved lightweight materials such as paper, bristle board,
and light adhesives.

The goal was to achieve the longest and most stable flight time
using only aerodynamic design and proper balance. The glider was
launched manually and relied completely on airflow and gravity
to remain in flight.

Key aerodynamic concepts applied:
• Lift – generated by the wings to keep the glider airborne 🪽
• Drag – minimized through smooth design to improve flight time 🌬️
• Stability – ensured using proper tail and wing alignment ⚖️
• Wing Span & Stabilizer Design – optimized for balance and control 📐

This competition improved our understanding of real-world aerodynamics,
team coordination, and hands-on engineering skills. It demonstrated
how theoretical knowledge can be successfully applied to practical
design challenges.
