Phase 1 – Knowledge Round 🧠📘

The first phase of GENESIZ ’25 was a challenging written examination
that tested the fundamental engineering knowledge of participants.

This round included questions from:
• Mathematics and Calculus ➗
• Physics and Applied Mechanics ⚙️
• Biology and Human Body Systems 🧬

The questions were mainly numerical, analytical, and application-based.
Participants were required to apply logical thinking, problem-solving
skills, and real-world engineering concepts to find accurate solutions.

This phase helped evaluate each team’s understanding of core principles
and their ability to think under time pressure. It laid a strong
foundation for the hands-on challenges that followed in later stages.
